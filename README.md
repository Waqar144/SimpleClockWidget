# A simple clock widget in Qt
It's basically a simple clock widget to display time.
I made it because often times when working I forget to look at the time and I need something very simple to set quick reminders.

### Features:

-   Lightweight
-   No borders/ background
-   Can change color/ font/ font size / opacity
-   Can switch between 12/24h Time format

### TODO:

-   Ability to set a reminder

## Compiling
1. If you have Qt Creator then just import the project and run!
Else
```
qmake && make
```
